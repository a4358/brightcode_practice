This project was done in a sort of haphazard way, for which i apologize. 
The ugliest part of the code is undoubtedly the algortihm meant for searching for pieces affected by a move (Board.list_affected),
which was implemented before it was discussed in class and the sunk cost fallacy prevented me from rewriting it cleanly until
there was no more time left. It does work however, and i have supplemented it with comments and a unit test to make it somewhat bearable.
Docstrings have proved very useful when doealing with more complex functions that take and give tuples as params
Git allowed me to not worry about losing the code i have written, and also faciliated organisation and 
allowed to easliy work from multiple devices.
I did not take full advantage of the unit tests until the very end (they came in handy once), but that is mostly due to figuring out most of the architecture
and doing a lot of work before we had them in class.
Not making a player class from the very begininng did waste some time when implementing different kinds of ai, but was not a terrible problem.

Overall i am happy with the project, but regretful that procrastination (my worst enemy) and other delays did not leave enough time to implement a proper GUI.
